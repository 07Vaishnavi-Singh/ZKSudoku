**FrontEnd
Writ ethe Front end in react
Add Zero Knwoledge to it 
Connect it withn smart Contract
Deplpoy

*Witness
The Witness is the secret Knowledge that I am giving inside the cirscuit like (age is 18)

*Challenge 
The answers and questions to check for th claims

*Verifier 
The person tat asks questiona and verifiers the proofs


**Non Interactive ZK proofs 
The proofs that do not require and intercation between the Proover and the Verifier 
In this the smart contract acts as the verifier to verifier whether the prrof generate bythe verifier is valid or not 

Circuit --> r1cs --> snarkjs --> Verifier and Proover

By compiling we get r1cs that generates witness using snarkjs 
Then we do the setup and generate keys and verifier and proover 




Powres of Tau is use dofr creating a trusted setup and in that Phase 1 is importnat and Phase 2 is optional
